// dnsRedirect owns --dns-redirect: the redirect that sends every resolver
// this netns and its docker bridges use through the proxy. It is the only
// thing that does: without it the proxy sees just the clients that pick it
// by choice, and any other resolver's answers never reach the firewall.
// Under an enforcing policy the job's allowed hostnames are then blocked on
// their bare IPs, which reads as a policy gap and pushes the operator to
// allow CDN addresses instead of fixing the capture. So a redirect that does
// not come up is a lost posture, and what that costs depends on the
// policy's mode, which is known only after the policy loads: by then the
// redirect must already be up, so setup records the failure and settle
// reports it.

// for it, then removes the table, which an unowned one needs, and flushes
// the flows DNAT'd to the proxy meanwhile, which even an owned one dying
